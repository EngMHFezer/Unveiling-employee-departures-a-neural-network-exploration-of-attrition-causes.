\cf2 \'a0\
## Project Overview\
This project aims to analyze employee attrition using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to employee demographics, job-related attributes, and behavioral metrics. The primary goal is to build predictive models that can help organizations identify factors contributing to employee attrition and assess their effectiveness in predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the company.\
\'a0\
### Key Features of the Project:\
- Data preprocessing, including handling categorical variables and spliting the dataset into training and testing sets.\
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between various features and employee attrition.\
- Implementation of three machine learning models: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).\
- Performance evaluation of each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\
\'a0\
## Dataset\
The dataset used for this analysis is the "HR-Employee-Attrition.csv," which contains 1470 entries and 35 columns. The columns include various employee attributes like Age, Gender, JobRole, and attrition status (Yes/No).\

## Technologies Used\
- Python\
- Pandas\
- NumPy\
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations\
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms\

\cf2 ## Google Colab Setup\
To run this project on Google Colab, follow these instructions:\
\
1. Open Google Colab: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)\
2. Create a new notebook by clicking on **New Notebook**.\
3. Clone the repository or upload the dataset (HR-Employee-Attrition.csv):\
   - To clone the repository, use the following command in a code cell:\
\
     !git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-attrition-analysis.git\
\
   - If you don't want to clone and prefer to upload it directly, you can upload the CSV file using:\
\
     from google.colab import files\
     uploaded = files.upload()\
\
\
4. Install the required libraries (if not already available in Colab):\
   !pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow\
\
5. Load the dataset and start your analysis by running the cells in the notebook.\
\'a0\
## Usage\
1. Run each code cell in sequence to perform EDA, preprocess the data, and build the machine learning models.\
2. Review the outputs, including performance metrics for each model for an understanding of their effectiveness.\
